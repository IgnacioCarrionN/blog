# About.

I'm Ignacio Carrión, I live in Valencia (Spain) and the one who appears on the avatar is my dog Wilfred. I like anything related to IT and videogames. At the moment I'm working as Android Engineer for [Tkww](https://theknot.com). Before that I worked as Android Developer for other companies and I worked as a programming teacher. While I was working as a teacher, I realized that I love learning and helping others to learn with me. From this motivation arises the idea of this blog, [Carrion.dev](https://carrion.dev). 

I hope I can publish something interesting about Kotlin or Android ecosystem at least twice a month. Constructive criticism or ideas about posts will be welcomed. Below you can see the links to my social networks where you can find and contact me.
