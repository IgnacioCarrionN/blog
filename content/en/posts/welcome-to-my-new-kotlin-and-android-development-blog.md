# Welcome to `Carrion.dev`

Hi droid!

Welcome to my new Kotlin and Android programming blog. I am Ignacio Carri√≥n and I'm an Android developer. I love Kotlin because it boost my Android development eficiency and because it has infinite posibilities outside of Android ecosystem (backend, web, native, multiplatform...).

In this blog I hope I can publish interesting topics about Kotlin and Android at least twice a month. If you want to keep up to date you can subscribe to our newsletter.

If you have any question, idea about some topic for the blog or you just want to contact with me, I'm available through my email: `ignacio@carrion.dev`.

I hope we can learn together!!
